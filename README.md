## Implementation Details

### Architecture Overview

FocusFlow is designed with a modern, full-stack architecture:

#### Frontend
- **React:** A dynamic user interface built with React enables responsive and interactive design.
- **React Router DOM:** Manages smooth navigation between pages (dashboard, tasks, notes, and wellness prompts).
- **Axios & Sass:** For handling HTTP requests and style pre-processing respectively.

#### Backend
- **Node.js & Express:** A robust RESTful API built with Express.js handles server-side logic and routes.
- **Knex & MySQL:** Utilized for database management, ensuring efficient data storage and retrieval through a structured relational schema.
- **Security & Configuration:** `dotenv` manages environment variables while `cors` ensures secure cross-origin requests.

### Key Libraries & Tools
- **Framer Motion:** Adds smooth animations to enhance user experience.
- **React-Beautiful-DND:** Enables intuitive drag-and-drop functionality within the right sidebar lists.

### Data & Database Schema

FocusFlow leverages a relational database with the following key entities:
- **Tasks:** Stores task details including title, description, due date, status, and associated tags.
- **Notes:** Maintains task-linked notes, which can be created, edited, and linked to specific tasks.
- **Tags:** Supports categorization for both tasks and notes.

#### Join Tables
- **task_tags:** Associates tasks with multiple tags.
- **note_tags:** Associates notes with multiple tags.

*Visual representations of the database schema and application mockups are available in the `assets/images` directory.*

FocusFlow offers a set of RESTful endpoints for seamless interaction between the frontend and backend:

#### Tasks Endpoints
